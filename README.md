### Beginner's League

# Challenge - Finding and Using Libraries
Find a cool beginner-friendly library (JS, Python, etc.) and use it to do something â€” draw a graph, animate text, or process text.

The python libraries used are qrcode and pillow for generating the OR code based on UPI ID .This supports payment apps like Google pay, Phone Pay and Paytm
Creates QR codes using the `qrcode` library
Displays QR codes using the `Pillow` image viewer

NOTE - Since this contains sensitive data like UPI ID, I did not depoly this project and also the demo video will not be available for an actual UPI id
For demonstration purpose i am using a fake upi id (but an  actual payment can be done for a real upi_id)

To try it out in your system
Requirements:
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```
